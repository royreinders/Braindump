#### Firewall review checklist (Work in progress)

* Komen de firewall regels overeen met die in het HLD
* Block traffic by default / deny all rule at the bottom of ruleset?
* Which routing protols are enabled
* If NGFW; which "Next Gen" AV/Signature/Antimalware features are enabled
* Which services are enabled on the firewall (SNMP, SSH etc)
* TLS Inspection enabled?
* How are logs stored (local, remote, retention policy, are logs reviewed?)
* Logging level (Verbose or not)
* Performance of the firewall (Does it have enough resources for the expected load?)
* Access to management interface (According to whitelist, local auth or LDAP?)
