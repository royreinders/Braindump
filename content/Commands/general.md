#### Build Windows executable from Python
PyInstaller freezes (packages) Python applications into stand-alone executables, under Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX.

Install PyInstaller from PyPI:
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
Go to your programâ€™s directory and run:
```
pyinstaller yourprogram.py
```
