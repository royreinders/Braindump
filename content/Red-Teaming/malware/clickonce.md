#### Info

IE also has some interesting interactions with these files and will automatically execute a manifest upon browsing to it – even on an internet-zoned site.  This means that on a hyperlink click we’ll be getting an NTLMv2 remotely over HTTP at a minimum (if the remote user is configured with IE as their default browser) and can get a shell with one more click.  This also gives us several different options for execution, as the deployment manifest can be sent directly as an attachment, embedded into an HTML and hosted, or hosted on a webserver and linked directly to via hyperlink.
